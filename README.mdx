# JanIT

janIT is the _Jan_ itor for G_it_. It aims to provide simple CLI for common Workflows on GitHub. Janit assumes that all commands are in the current working directory.

## Documented Workflows

### Labels as Code

> `janit labels init`

This workflow checks if there is a labels file as code. The default file is
`./.github/janit/labels.json`

If not, give a on-liner to create/pull this from an existing repo.
Provide a path or use the local repo from where the command is called.
On every run, diff labels from github and file. Warn on the diff.

## Template & Git commit message compare: 

> `janit compare [.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*] [URL/SHA]`

A binary that takes a local input (Issue Template, Git Commit template, label
lookup table), and does a comparison against what is submitted to GitHub.
Compare is considered to be the top level workflow. When used as a GitHub 
action, this runs through three steps, outlined below.

>  `janit validate template [ISSUETEMPLATE] [ISSUE #]`
This command is used to parse for `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*.md(x)` files as a
default, and diffs the issue template files against the body of the GitHub API
for that issue number.

- Checks if the template headings are followed.
- Checks if the template comment text is removed.
- Checks for custom definitions of the template formatting. (Stretch)

> `janit validate commit [COMMITTEMPLATE] -n [NUMBER OF COMMITS]`
This command will look at the last _n_ number of git log messages and compare
them against `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*.cmt` as a default. In a Github Action,
it will default to `-n 1`. The intention here is to be able to parse commit 
formatting and take action on the commits. For companies or projects that 
require Ticket-Based Engineering practices tied to a ticketing system, this is 
a good way to help along enforcement.

If the binary fails the commit as a precommit hook, the user can fix up the
message locally. If a merge is approved on a PR, it can be caught in CI and
make more uniform commit message suggestion. It will fail, NOT ERROR.

> `janit validate label [label_lookup_table] [GHIssue#]`
This command will look at a GitHub issue number in the current repo, and compare
the body of the issue against `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/label_table.yml`.
Once the input is validated, move to "labelling" section. This is not a 
labelling workflow, it is a validation workflow, and will not be called from 
the label subcommand.

Provide a lookup table file with the strings to parse for.

"The issue is with:"
"This issue affects:"

Provide a set of label rules that can be attached to them.

```
"The issue is with:" "everything"
- [bug,crash]
```

```
"This issue affects:" "ACLs"
- [theme/acls]
```

"I am not sure" - suggest but not apply tags.
If no strings from validation, then fail the issue.
Output whats missing, output recommend labels. 

## Label applier:
> janit labels apply [GHIssue#]

Once:
template is verified
Lookup table has no errors
Label exists as code in .github
Apply to issue.

## Project Layout
- `bin` - Ignored by git, but place your build artifacts here.
- `build` - Used to store build configurations for CI and dockerfiles.
- `cmd` - Commands used by the tool.
- `configs`- Used as example configurations.
- `docs` - Used to store documentation. This includes working notes and roadmap items.
- `internal` - For packages that are not meant to be shared.
- `pkg` - Packages for the tool.
