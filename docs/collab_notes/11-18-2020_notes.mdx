Rob and Jono discussed several workflows.

## Github authentication workflow
Github token is used to authenticate with github. This is for syncing information from the repo into GitHub.

In order to parse this token to the cli, users will to use one of the following options:

Order of precedence 
CLI input via argument or flag
ENV VAR - Environment variable
Config file that includes the api token - (local dev only)


## Labels as code workflows
Commands:
	Init - creates local copy of labels.json from github api response
	Diff - performs a comparison between local and remote label states
	Apply - check the labels.json file exists, performs a diff, apply diff (specify which version is authoritative) this would be a push or pull command based on user input.

Workflow 1:  `init` command
Pull the current labels from the github api response of that specific repository.
	_Preflight_
	Requires a .git folder
	Requires a .github

Logic:
If labels.json does not exist, 
Then
Query the GitHub API for this repository
And then, store the response as `api_label_data`.
And then, create `.github/janit/labels.json` (local state) file.
And then, store `api_label_data` in `.github/janit/labels.json`.

Workflow 2:  `diff` command
If `labels.json` (local state) does exist,
Then
Query the GitHub API for this repository
And then, store the response as `api_label_data` (remote state).
And then, diff between that and response from the github API.
And then, a warning message is given with information about syncing labels.	
		
WF 3: `Apply` Workflow
Runs `diff` workflow.
If a diff exists,
	Then
	Prompt user for which source to view as authoritative
		If the user chooses the local labels file (local state)
		Then
		Push the labels that are in `.github/janit/labels.json`.
		And then, delete the additional labels

		If the user chooses the GitHub API for the repository (remote state)
		Then
		Add the new label from diff to the labels that are in `.github/janit/labels.json`.
